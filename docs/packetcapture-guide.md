# Packet Capture User Guide

Starting with Antrea v2.0, Antrea supports the packet capture feature for network diagnosis.
It can capture specified number of packets from real traffic and upload them to a
supported storage location. Users can create a PacketCapture CRD to trigger
packet capture on the target traffic flow.

## Prerequisites

The PacketCapture feature is disabled by default. If you
want to enable this feature, you need to set PacketCapture feature gate to true in
the `antrea-config` ConfigMap for `antrea-agent`.

```yaml
  antrea-agent.conf: |
    # FeatureGates is a map of feature names to bools that enable or disable experimental features.
    featureGates:
    # Enable PacketCapture feature which provides packets capture feature to diagnose network issue.
      PacketCapture: false
```

## Start a new PacketCapture

When starting a new packet capture, you can provide the following information to identify
the target flow:

* Source Pod
* Destination Pod, Service or IP address
* Transport protocol (TCP/UDP/ICMP)
* Transport ports

You can start a new packet capture by creating a PacketCapture CR using
`kubectl`. Before that, a `Secret` named `antrea-packetcapture-fileserver-auth` located in `kube-system` namespace
must exist and carry the auth information for the target file server. You can also create the secret using
`kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic antrea-packetcapture-fileserver-auth -n kube-system --from-literal=username='<username>'  --from-literal=password='<password>'
```

And here is an example of `PacketCapture` CR:

```yaml
apiVersion: crd.antrea.io/v1alpha1
kind: PacketCapture
metadata:
  name: pc-test
spec:
  fileServer:
    url: sftp://127.0.0.1:22/upload # define your own ftp url here.
  timeout: 60
  type: FirstN
  firstNCaptureConfig:
    number: 5
  source:
    namespace: default
    pod: frontend
  destination:
    namespace: default
    pod: backend
    # Destination can also be an IP address ('ip' field) or a Service name ('service' field); the 3 choices are mutually exclusive.
  packet:
    ipHeader: # If ipHeader/ipv6Header is not set, the default value is IPv4 + ICMP.
      protocol: 6 # Protocol here can be 6 (TCP), 17 (UDP) or 1 (ICMP); default value is 1 (ICMP).
    transportHeader:
      tcp:
        dstPort: 8080 # Destination port needs to be set when the protocol is TCP/UDP.
```

The CRD above starts a new packet capture from a Pod named `frontend`
to the port 8080 of a Pod named `backend` using TCP protocol. It will capture the first 5 packets
that meet this criterion and upload them to the specified file server. Users can download the
packet file from the ftp server and analyze its contents with network diagnose tools
like Wireshark or `tcpdump`.
